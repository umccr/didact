# NOTE: super IMPORTANT!
# Because this docker lives at the root of a collection of projects - and we may have various points
# where those projects have folders with large files/lots of files - the .dockerignore is set by
# default to IGNORE ALL FILES.
# That is - each and every file/folder you want to be visible here for ADDing must be explicitly
# white listed in the .dockerignore.
